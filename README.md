#### Why do I exist?
### 2020 has been a challenging year for all of us.

As the year is ending, we thought to take a look back at all the contributions **you** as an individual
made to the open-source community, during these unprecedented times.

Also, since Spotify, Snapchat and other mass platforms have their own way of year wrap up, **why not us?**

### Reports

This web app deployed at [githubwrapped.tech](https://githubwrapped.tech) will help you to generate yearly reports that contains your stats from the beginning of this year.

Including number of commits, stars etc.

You can also save your report as an image using the 'Save Report' button and share it with the community or keep it as a memorandum :)
